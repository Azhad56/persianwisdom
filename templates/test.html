Paper Submission Guideline
Part A
Title Page
Title page is a separated page before the text. Provide the following information on the title page
(in the order given). It should include:Title

Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid
abbreviations and formulae where possible.
Author’s names and affiliations

Please indicate the given name and family name clearly. Present the authors' affiliation
addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations
with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of
the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the
country name, and, if available, the e-mail address, and telephone number of each
author.
Corresponding author

Clearly indicate who is willing to handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing,
publication and also post-publication. Ensure that telephone numbers (with country and
area code) are provided in addition to the e-mail address and the complete postal address.
Sponsoring information

If the research is sponsored or supported by an organization, please indicate it.
Part B
General Rules for Text
1. Please use the following rules for whole text, including abstract, keywords, heading and
references.
2. Front: (English) Times New Roman; Size: 12
3. Front: (Persian) B Lotus; Size: 16
Preparation of text
Abstract
A concise and factual abstract is required (maximum length of 250 words). The abstract should
state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract
is often presented separate from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. References should
therefore be avoided, but if essential, they must be cited in full, without reference to the
reference list.
Keywords
Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 8 keywords, avoiding general and plural
terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only
abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible.Subdivision of the article
Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered
1., 2., (then 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use
this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text.' Any subsection,
ideally, should not be more than 600 words. Authors are urged to write as concisely as possible,
but not at the expense of clarity.
Figures
Graphs, diagrams, chromatograms, photos, etc. should be prepared as clear, black and white (no
color), original positives, suitable for reproduction. All figures should be embedded within the
manuscript, and must be captioned and numbered sequentially.
References
Responsibility for the accuracy of bibliographic citations lies entirely with the authors.
Citations in the text
Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice
versa). Avoid citation in the abstract. Unpublished results and personal communications should
not be in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. Citation of a reference as 'in press'
implies that the item has been accepted for publication.
Citing and listing of web references


As a minimum, the full URL should be given. Any further information, if known (author
names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web
references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading
if desired, or can be included in the reference list.
Citations in the text should follow the referencing style used by the American
Psychological Association.
List

References should be arranged first alphabetically and then further sorted chronologically
if necessary. More than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be
identified by the letters "a", "b", "c", etc., placed after the year of publication.
